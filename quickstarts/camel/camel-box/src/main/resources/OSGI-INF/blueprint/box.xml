   This is the OSGi Blueprint XML file defining the Camel context and routes.  Because the file is in the
   OSGI-INF/blueprint directory inside our JAR, it will be automatically activated as soon as the bundle is installed.

   The root element for any OSGi Blueprint file is 'blueprint' - you also see the namespace definitions for both the Blueprint
   and the Camel namespaces.

      The namespace for the camelContext element in Blueprint is 'http://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint'. Additionally,
      we can also define namespace prefixes we want to use them in the XPath expressions in our CBR.

      While it is not required to assign id's to the <camelContext/> and <route/> elements, it is a good idea
      to set those for runtime management purposes (logging, JMX MBeans, ...)

          When this route is started, it will automatically create the work/box/input directory where you can drop the
          file that need to be processed.

          The <log/> elements are used to add human-friendly business logging statements. They make it easier to see what the
          route is doing.

          The <to/> element contains the Box.com destination endpoint.
